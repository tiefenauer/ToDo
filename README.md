# What is it?
ToDo is a very simple web app to keep track of your upcoming tasks.

# What CAN I do with it?

* add/Remove a task
* prioritize a task
* schedule a task by setting a deadline
* mark a task as finished
* edit an already added task
* delete a task

# What CAN'T I do with it
* synchronize with other devices (since the data is only stored locally...)
* login/logout (your tasks will only be visible to you on the device you entered them)
* share a task with others
* set a reminder
* cook an egg
* find out the meaning of life

# Where can I try it out?
